# MidiMaxGen TODO List

## Completed ✓

### Refactoring (January 2026)
- [x] Reorganized codebase into modular package structure
- [x] Created `midimaxgen/` package with submodules:
  - [x] `core/` - Note, Chord, Scale classes
  - [x] `patterns/` - Pattern base class, SimplePattern, GroupPattern
  - [x] `midi/` - MidiWriter class
  - [x] `arpeggiator.py` - Main Arpeggiator class
- [x] Added comprehensive docstrings and comments
- [x] Created README.md with usage documentation
- [x] Removed code duplication (gen_test.py duplicated in group_gen.py)
- [x] Added type hints throughout codebase
- [x] Parameterized hardcoded values (n, chord size)

## Future Enhancements

### High Priority
- [ ] Add unit tests for all modules
- [ ] Add setup.py for pip installation
- [ ] Stream/real-time MIDI output support
- [ ] Support for minor keys (automatic chord quality adjustment)

### Pattern Improvements
- [ ] Add more simple patterns (random, alberti bass, etc.)
- [ ] Configurable chord inversions per pattern
- [ ] Rhythm patterns (not just even notes)
- [ ] Accent patterns (varying velocity)

### Music Theory
- [ ] Support for borrowed chords (e.g., bVII in major)
- [ ] Secondary dominants (V/V, V/vi, etc.)
- [ ] Chord extensions (9ths, 11ths, 13ths)
- [ ] Voice leading optimization

### MIDI Features
- [ ] Multi-track support
- [ ] Tempo changes within a piece
- [ ] MIDI CC (Control Change) messages
- [ ] Pitch bend support
- [ ] Real-time MIDI output (not just file)

### User Interface
- [ ] Command-line interface (CLI)
- [ ] Simple GUI for non-programmers
- [ ] Preset library of common progressions

### Documentation
- [ ] API reference documentation
- [ ] Tutorial videos/guides
- [ ] More code examples

## Notes

### Original Files (kept for reference)
The original flat files are still in the root directory:
- arpeggiator.py (original)
- midi_generator.py (original)  
- group_gen.py (original)
- gen_test.py (original)

These can be removed once the new package structure is verified working.

### Dependencies
Required packages:
- mido: MIDI file I/O
- sympy: Group theory calculations (for advanced patterns)
