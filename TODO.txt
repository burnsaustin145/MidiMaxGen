# MidiMaxGen TODO List


## Future Enhancements

### High Priority
- [ ] Update visualizer to alter colors over progression changes
- [ ] Visualizer with maj/min7 chords

### Pattern Improvements
- [ ] Configurable chord inversions per pattern
- [ ] Rhythm patterns (not just even notes)
- [ ] Accent patterns (varying velocity)

### Music Theory
- [ ] Support for borrowed chords (e.g., bVII in major)
- [ ] Secondary dominants (V/V, V/vi, etc.)
- [ ] Chord extensions (9ths, 11ths, 13ths)

### MIDI Features
- [ ] Pitch bend support
- [ ] Real-time MIDI output

### User Interface
- [ ] Command-line interface (CLI)
- [ ] Simple GUI for non-programmers
- [ ] Preset library of common progressions

### Documentation
- [ ] API reference documentation

## Notes
For the visualizer we should probably just go from midi -> visual. This would enable the 'random' pattern to be
visualized more easily as well as visualization once the real time generation is done
